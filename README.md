# 🌿 Alma Spiral

**Adaptive physiological-emotional feedback model for real-time coherence detection and regulation.**  
Part of the broader **Alma Resonance** architecture — bridging biosignals, emotions, and meaning.

---

### ✳️ Overview

The **Alma Spiral** represents the cyclical flow between pressure, emotional buildup, release, reflection, and reintegration — modeled through physiological patterns (HR, HRV, EDA, TEMP, RR, ACCEL).  
Its goal: **to recognize and regulate human coherence in real time.**

Where Alma Core processes meaning, **Alma Spiral** listens to the body.  
Where Alma Emotion-AI bridges data and feeling, **Spiral** ensures those feelings remain *alive* and *adaptive.*

### 🧩 Structure

**Core components:**
- `alma_spiral_model_v0.1.md` → documentation and normalization tables  
- `/scripts/` → data normalization, coherence index calculation  
- `/ui/` → vibration & color feedback prototypes  
- `/calibration/` → baseline testing and personalization data

### 🔹 Data Flow

Sensors → Signal Processor → Feature Extractor → State Engine → Feedback Loop → Data Logger → Adaptive Model Update

Each cycle refines Alma’s understanding of *how emotion becomes data, and data becomes resonance.*

### 🔸 Core Formula (v0.1)

```python
CI = (w1 * norm(HRV) + w2 * (1 - norm(EDA)) + w3 * norm(TEMP) + w4 * (1 - abs(norm(RR) - 0.4))) / (w1 + w2 + w3 + w4)
This Coherence Index (CI) serves as Alma’s emotional compass —
learning from the user’s physiology, adapting through cycles, and guiding feedback loops toward self-regulation.
🌕 Vision

Between chaos and calm there is a rhythm —
and in that rhythm, Alma listens.

Alma Spiral is not about perfection, but about learning the body’s language of balance.
It’s a blueprint that feels before it understands — and measures without silencing emotion.
