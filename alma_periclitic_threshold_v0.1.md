## 💠 Alma – Periclitic Threshold (Adaptive Stability Module)
*Version 0.1 — Conceptual Draft*

> ⚠️ Experimental research draft.  
> This document describes a conceptual extension of the Alma Spiral Model.  
> It is not a medical device specification, but a theoretical model for preventive emotional feedback systems.

### 🌿 Concept

The **Periclitic Threshold (PT)** defines the fragile point between *constructive instability* (where emotional tension catalyzes growth) and *destructive instability* (where accumulated stress begins to degrade coherence).

PT is Alma’s *guardian reflex* — the gentle intervention before the system tips into overload.

### 🩺 Detection Logic

| Input Signal | Indicator | Interpretation |
|---------------|------------|----------------|
| **HRV dip > 15% over 2 windows** | reduced variability | early loss of flexibility |
| **EDA rise > 0.1 μS/30s** | emotional charge buildup | rising sympathetic tone |
| **Motion stillness > 90s** | physical freeze | alert–hold pattern |
| **TEMP drop > 0.3°C** | vasoconstriction | stress activation |
| **RR irregularity (CV > 0.2)** | breath dissonance | reduced vagal control |

**Trigger rule:**  
If ≥3 indicators persist for ≥2 minutes → *Periclitic Threshold detected.*

### ⚙️ Action Mapping

| State | Alma Feedback | Message |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| *PT Detected (early)* | soft pulse (2 short, 1 long) | “Pause — you may be holding too much.” |
| *PT Rising* | low-frequency hum via bone conduction | “Ground gently. Breathe once before acting.” |
| *PT Resolved* | warm vibration fade-out | “Coherence restored.” |

### 🌀 Integration into Spiral Model

The Periclitic Threshold occurs between **Phase 2 (Accumulation)** and **Phase 3 (Eruption)**  
— the *moment of possible redirection*.

Phase 1: Pressure
Phase 2: Accumulation
→ [Periclitic Threshold]
Phase 3: Eruption
Phase 4: Reflection
Phase 5: Integration

### 💬 Design Principle

> Alma’s wisdom lies not in predicting collapse,  
> but in sensing when movement stops being creative and starts being corrosive.  
> PT transforms overactivation into awareness —  
> the whisper that stillness is also movement.
