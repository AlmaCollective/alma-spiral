## 🎧 Alma – Subvocal–Emotional Interface (SEI)
*Version 0.1 — Conceptual Draft*

> ⚠️ Experimental research draft.  
> This document introduces the conceptual structure of Alma’s *Subvocal–Emotional Interface (SEI)* —  
> a bridge between speech intention and affective coherence.  
> It is not a medical or communication device specification.

### 🌀 Overview

The **SEI** module is designed to sense and harmonize the space between thought and expression —  
the subtle physiological and emotional signals that occur *before words are spoken*.

While traditional *subvocal systems* decode inner speech (neuromuscular signals for silent articulation),  
**Alma’s SEI** decodes the *emotional intention* beneath that pre-speech signal,  
translating it into coherent tactile feedback.

### 🧠 Layered Architecture

| Layer | Function | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **1. Intention Layer (Pre-Expression)** | Neural pre-activation | Emotional and semantic intention form before vocalization. Detected through minor HRV + EDA drift patterns. |
| **2. Signal Capture Layer** | Subvocal & affective micro-input | Jawline / temple sensors capture EMG-like micro-tensions and bone-conducted vibrations. |
| **3. Translation Layer** | Affective–Semantic Mapping | ML model maps micro-tension patterns + biosignal trends to an *Intent–Affect Vector (IAV)*. |
| **4. Feedback Layer** | Resonant Response | Bone-conductive actuators and vibro-haptic feedback realign emotional tone with expressive intent. |
| **5. Integration Layer** | Spiral Loop | IAV re-enters the Alma Spiral, refining Predictive Stability Index (PSI) and coherence calibration. |

### 🪶 Functional Flow

Thought → Pre-vocal Impulse (micro EMG)
↓
Affective Micro-Signal (EDA, HRV, RR)
↓
Fusion → Intent–Affect Vector (IAV)
↓
Feedback via bone/vibration → restored emotional resonance

### 💡 Conceptual Insight

> SEI listens to what the body intends to say,  
> not through words, but through the tremor of emotion before sound.  
>  
> It is the voice beneath the voice —  
> the resonance that connects meaning with feeling.

### 🧩 Integration Map

The SEI interacts directly with:
- **Alma Spiral Model** (coherence phases)
- **Predictive Stability Index (PSI)** (trend-based prediction)
- **Periclitic Threshold (PT)** (adaptive safety reflex)

Together they form a closed-loop system:
> *Intention → Emotion → Coherence → Expression → Integration.*
